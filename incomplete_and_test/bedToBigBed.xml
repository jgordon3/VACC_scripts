**What it does**

This tool converts BED file into a bigBed binary format. 

.. class:: infomark

bigBed format is useful for uploading large datasets into the UCSC Genome Browser.

.. class:: warningmark

The input BED file **must** be sorted by chromosome,start


------

From `bigBed Track format`__ page:

 .. __: http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html

The bigBed format stores annotation items that can either be simple, or a linked collection of exons, much as BED files do. BigBed files are created initially from BED type files, using the program bedToBigBed. The resulting bigBed files are in an indexed binary format. The main advantage of the bigBed files is that only the portions of the files needed to display a particular region are transferred to UCSC, so for large data sets bigBed is considerably faster than regular BED files. The bigBed file remains on your web accessible server (http, https, or ftp), not on the UCSC server. Only the portion that is needed for the chromosomal position you are currently viewing is locally cached as a "sparse file".
